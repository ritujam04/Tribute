            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p><strong>Early Life and Education</strong> 
                <br><br>
                Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). 
                He studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. 
                Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 and worked with Thomas Edison before 
                parting ways due to differing views on electrical systems.</p>
            <p>Throughout his life, Tesla contributed to the development of the 
                alternating current (AC) electrical system, wireless communication, 
                and numerous other inventions. Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled 
                financially and died in relative obscurity on January 7, 1943.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Career and Innovations</strong>  
                <br><br>
                Tesla moved to Budapest in 1881, where he worked for the Central Telephone Exchange. In 1882,
                 he moved to Paris to work for the Continental Edison Company, where he gained hands-on experience 
                 in electrical engineering.
                
                In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States and worked under Thomas Edison. 
                However, conflicts arose between the two due to differences in their approaches to electrical power.
                 Tesla was a strong advocate of alternating current (AC), while Edison promoted direct current (DC).
                <br><br>
                <strong> War of Currents</strong>
                <br><br>
                Tesla eventually partnered with <strong>Westinghouse</strong> , who supported AC power as 
                a superior alternative to Edison's DC system. This led to the <strong> War of Currents</strong>, a fierce battle 
                between AC and DC technologies. Tesla’s <strong>AC System</strong> ultimately won, leading to the widespread adoption 
                of AC power grids, which remain in use today.  
              
                <br><br>
                <strong>Later Years and Death</strong>  
                <br><br>
                Tesla spent his later years working on ambitious projects, including <strong>wireless energy transmission</strong> 
                and a <strong>death ray</strong> concept. Unfortunately, he struggled financially and became increasingly reclusive.  
                <br><br>
                On <strong>January 7, 1943, </strong> Tesla passed away alone in his New York hotel room. Despite his 
                financial struggles, his legacy remains immense. In 1960, the <strong> SI unit of magnetic flux density (the Tesla, T)</strong> was named in his honor.  
                <br><br>
                <strong>Legacy</strong>
                <br><br>
                Tesla’s visionary ideas continue to inspire modern technologies,
                 including <strong> wireless charging, renewable energy, and radio communications </strong>. 
                 He is widely regarded as one of the greatest inventors in history.</p>
